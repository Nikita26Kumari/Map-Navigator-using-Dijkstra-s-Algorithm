# Map Navigator using Dijkstra's Algorithm

## Overview

This Java application implements Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph. It simulates a map where nodes represent locations and edges represent paths between these locations with associated weights. The algorithm computes the shortest distance from a source node to all other nodes in the graph.

## Features

- **Shortest Path Calculation**: Efficiently computes the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in the graph.
- **Graph Representation**: Uses an adjacency matrix to represent the graph.
- **Output**: Displays the shortest distance from the source node to every other node in the graph.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Algorithm**: Dijkstra's Algorithm
- **Data Structures**: Arrays

- Output:
- Vertex        Distance from Source
0             0
1             25
2             30
